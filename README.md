# Machine-Learning-Note
 Are you learning Machine Learning? And looking for a detailed and intuitiative note to help you understand better Deep Learning (Neural Nets).

 You come to the right place!

 Even I do note it kinda randomly, but if you also come from a programing background with litter or only basic calculus, check these note out!

 Cheers and hope you ace the ML black box,
